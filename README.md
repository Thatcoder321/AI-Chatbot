Needs API key
My Story:
I was just thinking about python projects to start at home since I was bored, I worked on a python phone for over an year but that was before high seas and I needed to submit something that would work with high seas so I thought, what are some cool projects I could make that would enhance a users life? That's it, something with AI, but what with AI I thought to myself...
I could make a game that gives the user a summary with AI, but that's not that fun and it's not always daily
But then it came to me! A AI chat would be an awesome idea! So the user can talk to it directly from python and get the same amount of accuracy as the real chatgpt(because of API, would not be able to train my own AI lol)
So I worked a lot on it, weirdly focused on design a lot, becuase it should be convienent to use, because I don't want users having to take a really long time for stuff to load, so I made it look organized, just like the real app, you could name your chats, you could go to past chats, and more!
When the first update released it was good, I mean you could talk to the AI and all, memory was nice! (Scrolling was slow though) I never was planning on updating it I thought it was good enough for daily use until I realized 
The main thing that it did not have but really needed? Customizable looks! Nothing was customizable enough! The only AI that could be used was gpt-4o-mini, the colors were the same, and you could not set instructions for the AI, and since my goal was for it to be as user friendly and personalized as possible, I decided to make it even better by adding this customizability!
I went to work and completely updated it!(Made scrolling smoother lol)
And then after a lot of hard work the project did have a lot of bugs but I was able to fix that after some more work
What came out as the final result?
A completely new look! You could change AI models, give the AI custom instrucitons, change themes, and more!
I really liked how everything turned out!(Other than how stressed I got for all the bugs)
And I really do hope if you have an API key, you try this out because trust me, it is really easy to use and is just like the real thing!
